# Wordle
Welcome to the Wordle Game in Python repository! This simple yet engaging text-based game is a Python implementation of the popular Wordle game, where your goal is to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer.

## Basic Rules
- Each guess must be a valid five-letter English word.
- You have six attempts to guess the correct word.
- Feedback is provided for each letter in your guess:
- Green (G) for correct letters in the right position.
- Yellow (Y) for correct letters in the wrong position.
- Black (B) for letters not present in the target word.
- The game ends when you guess the word correctly or exhaust all six attempts.
